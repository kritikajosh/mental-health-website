   <h1>Depression Test (Self-Assessment)</h1>
   <p style="font-size: larger;"></p> 
  Below is a list of 10 questions designed to help you determine if you might be experiencing depression. The questions relate to life experiences common among people who have depression. Please read each question carefully, and indicate how often you have experienced the same or similar challenges in the past few weeks.
  This quiz is NOT a diagnostic tool. Mental health disorders can only be diagnosed by a licensed mental health provider or doctor.

All too often people stop short of seeking help out of fear their concerns aren't legitimate or severe enough to warrant professional intervention.
